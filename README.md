# Lua-minecraft-turtles
Scripts for ComputerCraft for modded Minecraft written in Lua

These scripts are for modded Minecraft (Im using FTB Infinite) to automate various tasks in-game.
Uses ComputerCraft (CC) APIs such as Turtle, Rednet, and Modem etc.

First run 'mcTurtleScript' on your turtles already placed on the bottom-left of your farm(s).  

Then you can place down a Computer and run 'farmComputerControl X Y' where X and Y are the dimensions of the farm
